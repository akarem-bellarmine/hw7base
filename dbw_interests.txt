I am interested in learning more about cybersecurity. Learning different methods to secure information and constantly having to work around newly discovered vulnerabilities sounds like an interesting puzzle/game to play. It is also least likely to be overwhelmed with AI in the near future as cybersecurity has to constantly evolve to not become outdated.
