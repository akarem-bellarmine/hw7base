Out of every CS discipline I know of, I'm most interested in Graphics. Changing the visuals or making 3D environments and such seems like a fun time. I watched a lot of videos of this guy, Acerola on YouTube, who IS a graphics programmer and he has so much knowledge in the subject. One of his videos where on how his thought process of things from early highschool to when he actually got a job on the field. He was clueless on what he wanted to do, he got I believe a Bachelors on chemistry, which he doesn't even really use, so he decided to just learn everything about Graphics on his own time outside of school, since his school didn't offer it. Very interesting. I think the latest video he made was generating fractals and animating them between each other or something like that. I really liked the one where he was working with ASCII art though. There's so many interetsing things you can do with Graphics, and it also helps giving my knoweledge in math since Graphics programming requires a good knowledge of, and I'll finally have a use case for what I'm learning. This is all ust an idea for now. I'm going to look into more things before I ultimately decide.
