Machine learning is a subdiscipline of computer science centered on creating programs and algorithms that can recognize patterns given data as input. Personally, I'm looking to learn more about ML because it sits uniquely at the intersection of math & statistics, computer science, and business. Most machine learning models are based on the following general template; a mathematical model/method of generating such a model is chosen that acccurately represents a certain relationship or problem. In this case, we could talk about weather patterns. By feeding data into this model (ex. the last 5 years of weather data), you can generate a prediction, and use another subset of so-called training data to correct or verify that prediction. In this way, these ML programs identify trends in ways that may still require human analsysis but save incredible amounts of time; sometimes even making practically impossible tasks possible, such as with DNA sequencing and ML in bioinformatics.
